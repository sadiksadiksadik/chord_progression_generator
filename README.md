# Chord Progression Generator

A tool designed to assist in the music compositional, and improvisational process. 

## What does this tool do?
This tool creates random, but musically sound progressions based on Western Harmony.

### TODO
* Utilise machine learning/markov chains to create random progressions that are derived from and trained on different genres, to create realistic new progressions in the 'style of:x'
